        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Button Disabled While Loading:</b> The <em>'Fetch Cats!'</em> button should be disabled until the images finish loading to prevent multiple requests.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Clear Previous Images:</b> When pressed again, previously loaded cat images should be removed from the page, and the new images should replace them.
